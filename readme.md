# Graded Project - Mahanoro Station

![Design preview for the Mahanoro station coding challenge](./design/1.png)

In this project our challenge is to build a website that will allow us to reserve some seats in ``Taxi brousses` departure from Mahanoro. Also we have to get it work with `redux`, `compound components` and `styled components`, and then make it lokk as close to the design as possible.

## Built with
- [React]()
- [Redux]()
- [Compound components]()
- [Styled components]()
- [Html]()
## Fonctionality:
Users should be able to 
- pick a city from the city list,
- see the available trips to that city, and pick one where seats are still available.
- select one or more seats in the car, and see how much it's going to cost
- comfirm the booking
- see their comfirmed booking on the `My account` page
- Modify their own information, like name or phone number, on that same page.
